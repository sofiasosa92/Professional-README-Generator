# Professional-README-Generator

For this challenge i created a professional README generator using node.js backend and Node Inquirer library to help the user enter general
README information for any project using the Integrated Terminal in VS code. Having a well built and organized README is vital to a developer
to help describe and explain to the user any coding project.
